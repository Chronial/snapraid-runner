# Snapraid Runner Script

This script runs snapraid, and sends it output to the console, a log file and
via email. All this is configurable.

It can be run manually, but its main purpose is to be run via cronjob/windows
scheduler.

## How to use
* If you donâ€™t already have it, download and install
  [the latest python 2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/).
* Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner/releases)
  of this script and extract it anywhere or clone this repository via git.
* Copy/rename the `snapraid-runner.conf.example` to `snapraid-runner.conf` and
  edit its contents. You need to at least configure `snapraid.exectable` and
  `snapraid.config`.
* Run the script via `python snapraid-runner.py`.

## Features
* Runs `diff` before `sync` to see how many files were deleted and aborts if
  that number exceeds a set threshold.
* Can create a size-limited rotated logfile.
* Can send notification emails after each run or only for failures.
* Can run `scrub` after `sync`
