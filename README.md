# Snapraid Runner Package

This python package runs snapraid and sends its output to the console, a log file and
via email. All this is configurable.

It can be run manually, but its main purpose is to be run via cronjob/windows
scheduler.

It supports Windows, Linux and macOS and requires at least python3.7.

## How to use
* If you donâ€™t already have it, download and install
  [the latest python version](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner/releases)
  of this package.
* Install the release with pip via `python3 -m pip install snapraid-runner-x.x.tar.gz` on Linux or `py -3 -m pip install snapraid-runner-x.x.tar.gz` on Windows
* Copy/rename the `snapraid-runner.conf.example` to `snapraid-runner.conf` and
  edit its contents. You need to at least configure `snapraid.executable` and
  `snapraid.config`.
  * [The wiki](https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner/wiki/How-to-use-snapraid-runner-with-gmail)
    has details on how to use gmail for sending mail.
* Run the script via `snapraid-runner` command on Linux or Windows.

## Uninstalling
* To uninstall simply run `python3 -m pip uninstall snapraid-runner` on Linux or `py -3 -m pip uninstall snapraid-runner`

## Features
* Runs `diff` before `sync` to see how many files were deleted and aborts if
  that number exceeds a set threshold.
* Can create a size-limited rotated logfile.
* Can send notification emails after each run or only for failures.
* Can run `scrub` after `sync`

## Scope of this project and contributions
Snapraid-runner is supposed to be a small tool with clear focus. It should have 
minimal dependencies to keep installation trivial. I always welcome bugfixes
and contributions, but be aware that I will not merge new features that I feel
do not fit the core purpose of this tool.

I keep the PRs for features I do not plan on merging open, so if there's a
feature you are missing, you can have a look
[at the open PRs](https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner/pulls).
