# Snapraid Runner Script

This script runs snapraid and sends its output to the console, a log file and
via email. All this is configurable.

It can be run manually, but its main purpose is to be run via cronjob/windows
scheduler.

It supports Windows, Linux and macOS and runs on both python2 and python3.

## How to use
* If you donâ€™t already have it, download and install
  [the latest python version](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner/releases)
  of this script and extract it anywhere or clone this repository via git.
* Copy/rename the `snapraid-runner.conf.example` to `snapraid-runner.conf` and
  edit its contents. You need to at least configure `snapraid.exectable` and
  `snapraid.config`.
* Run the script via `python3 snapraid-runner.py` on Linux or
 `py -3 snapraid-runner.py` on Windows.

## Features
* Runs `diff` before `sync` to see how many files were deleted and aborts if
  that number exceeds a set threshold.
* Can create a size-limited rotated logfile.
* Can send notification emails after each run or only for failures.
* Can run `scrub` after `sync`
* Can run `smart`. For this to work, you need [smartmontools](https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Download).
  Most Linux distributions will have it installed installed by default.
  * Windows users may install using the packaged .exe installer found at this link or
    use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (i.e., `choco install smartmontools`).
  * Mac OS users may install using the packaged .dmg installer found at this link or
    use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (i.e., `brew install smartmontools`).
  * Linux users may check for smartmontools using `smartctl -V`, if not installed use
    your distribution's package manager to install `smartmontools`
    (e.g., `apt-get install smartmontools`, `yum install smartmontools`, etc.)
